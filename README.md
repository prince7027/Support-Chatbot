Overview
This project implements a simple chatbot model using a machine learning pipeline. The model can process text input, predict responses, and return them via an API built using Flask.

The pipeline includes:

Text preprocessing using TF-IDF.
A machine learning model for classification.
An API for serving the model and making predictions.
Features
Text input is preprocessed using TF-IDF vectorization.
Trained on a custom dataset for chatbot responses.
Exposes a simple Flask API for predictions.
Can be easily extended with more advanced models or data preprocessing techniques.
Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

Flask
joblib
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-pipeline.git
2. Install the dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd chatbot-pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train and Save the Model
If you haven't already trained the model, you can train it by running the following Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
This script will preprocess the text data, train the model, and save it using joblib.

4. Run the Flask API
To start the Flask API and make predictions, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will start the Flask server locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

5. Use the API
To interact with the model, send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with a JSON body containing the text input:

Example using curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"Hello, chatbot!"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
The response will contain the model's predicted output.

Model Training Details
Text Preprocessing: The text input is preprocessed using TF-IDF vectorization.
Model: A Random Forest Classifier is used to classify the chatbot's responses.
Training Data: A custom dataset of dialogues is used to train the model.
